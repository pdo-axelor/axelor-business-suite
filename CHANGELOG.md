### Improvements
- Default partner type
- Remove sublines of SOlines : SubLine will be replaced per a title line to group some lines.
- Rename saleOrder status and field :
On saleOrder object :
the "confirm" status must be rename to "finalize".
the "validate" status must be rename to "orderConfirm"
the "validationDate" field must be rename to "confirmationDate"
the "validatedByUser" field must be rename to "confirmedByUser"
- Add sale order version management :
Versions will allow users to modify an order already finalyse :
when switching to finalyse status, save the order's PDF as an attachment. If it is the first version, only use order sequence for the name of the PDF. For later version we have to suffix order's PDF name by "-V" + numversion
Add new button called "New version" displayed in finalize status. This button will go back to draft status, and increment the version number.
Add checkbox in general settings to know if the feature must be used or not into the application
- Add cancel reason on saleOrder : When clicking on cancel sale order button, add intermediate popup to specify the cancel reason. Select a cancel reason must be required.
- SaleOrder : modify stockMove generation management.
Management of stockMove generation button display :
This button must be displayed only on "orderConfirm" status
By clicking on the button, a new StockMove will be created with all saleOrder's line and with "Planned" status. If a stockMove was already generated, an information message must appeared specifying that an other stock move can't be generated.
- A new pointed field must be added into stockmove to know his invoicing state. A stockmove is linked to only one invoice, so we can based on invoice status to know if a stockmove is invoiced or not.
- New status of delivery in sale order :
Add new column status named "delivery state" containing 3 values :
not delivered
partially delivered
delivered
When the stockMove will be realized, the delivery status will change to "delivred" if there isn't any back order and "partially delivered" if there is one.

If an active supplier arrival already exists for a purchase order (ie status must be different from cancel)
In case of manual generation, an information message will be displayed to specify that an active supplier arrival already exists (in case of no auto-generation).
In case of auto generation, no new supplier arrival will be generated automatically (no impact for the user)
Add M2O into invoice to purchase order
Add M2O into invoice line to purchase order line (like sale order)
Use the checkbox "manageAmountInvoiceByLine" in general settings to know if the invoice amount management is done by line or not (as for sale order)
Automatically update remaining amount to invoice for purchase order :
if the M2O on invoice to sale order (purchase order) is not null, then use it
if it is null, then use the M2O on invoice line to sale order line (purchase order line)
this auto-update must be called during :
invoice ventilation
invoice cancellation
- SaleOrder : manage objects generation depending on general settings parameters
Add 6 new checkboxes in general settings to know if the generation process must be triggered automatically or not :
2 for stock move generation : 1 to know if it we want to use stock moves in the application. And another one if the first is checked to know if the generation will be manual or automatic
2 for purchase order generation : 1 to know if it we want to use purchase orders in the application. And another one if the first is checked to know if the generation will be manual or automatic
